# First major GitHub project
##Xarozorax - 2023/02/04
### This 'README.MD' is going to largely be:
**A documentation of my thoughts and feelings throughout the process of my 30DaysOfPython journey**

**It will have 'daily' updates, and will give me a chance to give subjective updates, as opposed to the objective Git updates**

All day-of-challenge directories were initialized on day_one, with the script in day_one directory

Any other subdirectories may be made on a day-to-day basis

Some may be automated

As I have *some* experience working with programming languages, I will be utilizing features
that aren't necessarily introduced yet in the project course. This will taper off as I 
progress further into the project. **Note** At 02:00, 20230206, CST, I realized that a
.MD file is... a MarkDown file. Feels pretty obvious in hindsight.

Another thing to note is that I am essentially doing most of these exercises ~~at least~~ twice

    * Once at work, quick and dirty
        * just to make sure I have a decent idea of what I'm doing
    * Then again at home, when I get back from work
        * this verifies that I have an idea of what I'm trying to do
        * this also allows me to make 'improvements' to what I thought up at work
        * I also get plenty of time to Google pitfalls and confounding issues
        * finally, it allows me to think of other control-flow/data strucures that 
        * will allow for better optimization and/or 'enterprisability'

Also, any misspellings in the comments will likely be due to my copy-pasting from the 30 Days Of Python repo

Additionally, something I just discovered, and the source of an oddity with the files on day_3:
The __name__ that was in the commit before this, for the files that weren't geometry.py, were because I was trying to 
troubleshoot what was ultimately a terminal issue, not a python issue, even though it presented as a python one.


###-- Notice --

I may be... distracted... from 30DaysOfPython for a bit. This is not only due to the fact that I'm currently in the 
middle of moving, but also because I am beginning a side-project that I've had in mind for quite some time. I've only
recently become adept enough with writing code that I think I can accomplish it... or at least I hope so. I have already
started the Git repo on my local machine, and I will push it to GitHub in one of two scenarios:
1) I have a 0.0.1 version of the project to release; or
2) I need help, and I can't figure it out on my own via Google and StackOverflow. 

Option two is quite probably more likely.
