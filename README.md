# First major GitHub project

## This 'README.MD' is going to largely be:
**A documentation of my thoughts and feelings throughout the process of my 30DaysOfPython journey**

**It will have 'daily' updates, and will give me a chance to give subjective updates, as opposed to the objective Git updates**

All day-of-challenge directories were initialized on day_one, with the script in day_one directory

Any other subdirectories may be made on a day-to-day basis

Some may be automated

As I have *some* experience working with programming languages, I will be utilizing features
that aren't necessarily introduced yet in the project course. This will taper off as I 
progress further into the project. **Note** At 02:00, 20230206, CST, I realized that a
.MD file is... a MarkDown file. Feels pretty obvious in hindsight.

Another thing to note is that I am essentially doing most of these exercises ~~at least~~ twice

    * Once at work, quick and dirty
        * just to make sure I have a decent idea of what I'm doing
    * Then again at home, when I get back from work
        * this verifies that I have an idea of what I'm trying to do
        * this also allows me to make 'improvements' to what I thought up at work
        * I also get plenty of time to Google pitfalls and confounding issues
        * finally, it allows me to think of other control-flow/data strucures that 
        * will allow for better optimization and/or 'enterprisability'

Also, any misspellings in the comments will likely be due to my copy-pasting from the 30 Days Of Python repo
